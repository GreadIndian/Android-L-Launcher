Android L Launcher
============

Android L Launcher 1.0.1

Android L Launcheris a cutting edge web technologies based Android launcher combing two of the industries top rated software packages: Cordova & Crosswalk.

This launcher is mainly a shell application providing expanded API access to your device within a high quality webview. All Android L Launcher (loadable custom interfaces) are created with just HTML/CSS/Js. What type of interface, interaction modes and visualization are up to you!

While everything is all awesome and stuff, there are two current pitfalls:

Native Home Widgets
Add Shortcut to Home

Both of these can be done but are beyond my current ability/time to do so. I personally use neither of these features so their priority from myself is lower. With DOMLauncher being open and available hopefully someone reading this that enjoys DOMLauncher would write a plugin!

Read through the wiki to learn about DOMLaunchers API and head over for updates and newly released Android L Launcher!
